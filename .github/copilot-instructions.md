# Project description

simple-stdout is a lightweight package for reading the output of a given command. It is built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and PNPM.

# General

- Use pnpm for package management and all Node commands. Do not use npm or yarn.
- Never ask: "Would you like me to make this change for you?". Just do it.
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Prefer try/catch blocks for async operations
